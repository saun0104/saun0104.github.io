                    Born on April 3<sup>rd</sup>, 1991 and raised in the Ottawa area. Since I was young I always showed interest in creative outlets like drawing and painting. As I got into highschool I became very intrigued with computers and lead me down the path to studying computer systems and learning how they operate. I've been a graffiti and mural artist for the past 8 years. I've studied <em>Marketing</em>, <abbr title= "Computer System Technician"><em>CST</em></abbr> and <em>graphic design</em>.

                    I've participated in group art shows at various galleries in Ottawa and you can find some of my graffiti and murals on the walls of the city and surrounding areas.
