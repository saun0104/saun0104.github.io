                    I'm a second-year Interactive Media Design student at Algonquin College. Born and raised in Ottawa, Ontario, I've always had a passion for creating and designing. As a teenager, I was a self-taught artist who enjoyed creating works with traditional artistic mediums. After discovering graffiti, I became obsessed with typography and colour theories.

                <p>
                    I've enjoyed being able to express myself through art, and I also love being able to help others express their ideas the way they envision them. But I've always had one other passion, computers. I took classes to be a computer systems technician, but I knew that I couldn't give up being creative and artistic. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Designing and building websites, creating logos, user experience design, and shooting and editing photographs/videos are all perfect blends of my two passions. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On my two-year journey into interactive media design, I've learned the foundational skills for a wide range of design disciplines.  From digital product design to experience design. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a fast learner and can pick up new skills and work on different projects and roles with relative ease. Growing up playing team sports, I always understood the importance of working together, and I enjoy and thrive in team environments.
