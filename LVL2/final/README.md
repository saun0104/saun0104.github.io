I wanted to design my portfolio as a very clean and simple website. I wanted the home page to be fun and engaging which is why I went with the hover animation styled menu.

However creating that menu was definitely my biggest challenge during this assignment. I found that watching some great web developers on youtube and just reading tips and tricks on sites like stackoverflow really helped me out trying to troubleshoot any issues I ran into. 

During the assignment, although I did feel fairly comfortable with animations, I really was able to wrap my head around animations a lot more and enjoy working with them a lot more.

I did have to alter and add somethings here and there compared to my prototype, but I am really happy with the way it turned out and I look forward to using, and updating my portfolio in the future.
